# Uber Ride Data Analysis ðŸš–

This project analyzes Uber ride data to uncover patterns in ride usage, including distributions across ride categories, purposes, months, days, and times. Insights are visualized through a dashboard to help make data-driven operational and business decisions.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing of raw Uber ride dataset
- Extraction of date, time, month, year, and trip duration from timestamps
- Visualization of ride patterns using count plots, bar charts, heatmaps, and distributions
- Dashboard summarizing key insights: ride distribution, miles traveled, and usage trends
- Recommendations for operational efficiency, marketing, and customer satisfaction

## Project Structure
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `UberDataset.csv` | Raw Uber ride dataset |
| `UberDatasetCleaned.csv` | Cleaned and processed dataset |
